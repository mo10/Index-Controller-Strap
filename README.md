## Warranty
If you have warranty, I don't recommended to repair it yourself.
Opening the outside enclosure of your Steam hardware will void a warranty.

## Model
Part of this model comes from https://github.com/ValveSoftware/IndexHardware. The missing part was measured by me.

## Teardown
The strap is fixed with rivet. You need to drill the rivet with an electric drill.
